GAMES AND TECH
-can create a seperate component for useEffect and then return it (deprecated)
-tech: clicking on faang nvidia and then faang again breaks the button (resolved when making get requqest from own node.js server)
-can optimize more on overall styling finish 

MAINPAGE
-fix the swiper stories slider--> use react responsive package and make it a column just like games and tech tab (NextJS Hydration error)
-main center video section img--> modal --> fullscreen? idea is fetch video info from youtube api--> display info in the carousel --> clicking on center main button will fetch and autplay yotube video given embed parameter
-->
